# regular_military_time_converter
Code created for the Michael Reeves Coding Challenge number one.

It basically converts a usert-typed time input from a 12h format to a 24h format or vice-versa.
The input should follow a format similar to "12:30 am". I've tried to make it dumb-input-proof, though.
